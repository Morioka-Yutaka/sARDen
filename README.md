# sARDen
sARDen is a SAS toolkit for producing CDISC ARS–aligned Analysis Results Data (ARD). Inspired by the R pharmaverse cards schema, it respectfully mirrors ARD conventions for cross-language workflows. Macros cover summaries, tabulations, and hierarchical stacking, outputting long-format ARDs plus ARDM-like metadata via XATTR for traceability.
