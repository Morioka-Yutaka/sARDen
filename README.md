# sARDen
sARDen is a SAS toolkit for producing CDISC ARS–aligned Analysis Results Data (ARD). Inspired by the R pharmaverse cards schema, it respectfully mirrors ARD conventions for cross-language workflows.  
Macros cover summaries, tabulations, and hierarchical stacking, outputting long-format ARDs plus ARDM-like metadata via XATTR for traceability.

## Test Data
We use ADSL and ADAE created as test data with the “sas_faker” package (https://github.com/Morioka-Yutaka/sas_faker),   
but you can freely substitute typical ADSL/ADAE datasets instead, so feel free to adapt that part as you like.
